This file allows the creation of a BoardingPass object that can store the name and pass number of a user.
The methods allow the values of the object to be returned and changed to given value.

Potential improvement: Set the contructor to create a random pass number that is unique among all the BoardingPass objects.

Potential implementation: Have the contructor accept an array of all BoardingPass objects. A random number generator will create a pass number
and check each BoardingPass object for a match. If there is a match, the number will be generated again. If not, the loop ends.

Note for implementation: The array of BoardingPass objects must be initialized and exist in the main method to persist between calls. The main
method's array should also be updated to include the new object each time a new BoardingPass object is created.

//Update//
The random generator contructor for the class has been created. The testing class succeeds in creating a unique number, but the method should be
further tested in the Test branch.
