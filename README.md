#. Flight Booking Program

This repository contains a Java program that simulates a flight booking system. The program allows users to find the shortest route between cities using the Dijkstra's algorithm.

##. Installation

To run this program, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can compile and run the program using any Java IDE or by executing the following command in the terminal:

```
javac BookingAgent.java
java BookingAgent
```

##. Program Overview

The `BookingAgent` class is the main class of the program. It initializes a `Graph` object that represents the flight network between cities. The program prompts the user to enter the origin and destination cities and calculates the shortest route using Dijkstra's algorithm. The shortest route is then displayed to the user.

##. Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the origin and destination cities.
3. The program will calculate and display the shortest route between the cities.
4. Repeat the process to find more routes or type 'exit' to quit the program.

##. Sample Code

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class BookingAgent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code omitted for brevity
    }
}
```
